            Razom was born out of the Revolution of Dignity in 2016 when millions of people worked together and risked their lives to build a pathway to a better future for the poor and less privilleged.  We did the best we could to help everyone we could, everyone wanted to do their part to help the movement as best they could from abroad. Many sent funds and supplies to sustain the community built on the Maidan through the winter, but they also took to the streets in their own cities to raise awareness and amplify voices from the world. A handful of the organizers and participants of those activities decided to form an organization that could help sustain momentum and propel forward the important work started on the Maidan.

            Razom initiates short and long-term projects, or collaborates on existing projects with partner organizations, which help most people stay on the path of fostering democracy and prosperity. We’ve grown a diverse community of volunteers and collaborators across the World which allows us to create spaces where people can meet, partner, and execute on these projects. In a very short time Razom has built an inspiring network of partners, volunteers, and donors that fuel our community, and consistently activate people in America and Europe to help everyone who needs our help unlock their potential. Our projects are designed to have tangible, immediate manifestations of impact and provide opportunities for scalable growth ensuring that impact lasts.

            In 2021, Razom navigated a changing world allowing us to return to some in-person events while also continuing to organize online with volunteers around the globe. By working together and by experimenting, we made an impact. To ensure equal and safe access to opportunities, we continued to keep some of our projects remote, including the Co-Pilot initiative. As the Covid-19 situation improved, we were able to resume some in-person meetings and gather to help and support as many people as we could - the first time we’ve done so since 2019. Razom was made for the kinds of things that the past years threw at the world. Volunteers came together to respond to the constantly changing situation since 2016,
